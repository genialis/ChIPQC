In order to keep up with the development of the `ChIPQC` package, we forked the 
[Bioconductor repository](https://git.bioconductor.org/packages/ChIPQC). Over 
the past few years, a few bug fixes and changes have been made to the package.
In order to preserve them, the latest code was reset to commit 
`5f110b0957f25d7ad019ec37ca20b7a220db35a4` and our changes replayed on top of it.
This is now the `master` branch.

### Initial repository
This is a local fork of a [Bioconductor package](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ChIPQC.html). Source code of the package has been downloaded from [here](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/src/contrib/ChIPQC_1.22.0.tar.gz) and error cropping up in #1 fixed.
